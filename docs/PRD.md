### Why These Choices?

**Vite over Create React App:**

- Excellent TypeScript support
- Optimized for static site generation

**GitHub Pages:**
- Free hosting with HTTPS

## Deployment Architecture

### Dual Deployment Strategy

**Primary Deployment: Vercel**
- **Host:** Vercel
- **URL:** https://karstenwade.com (custom domain)
- **Base Path:** `/` (root)
- **Deploy Method:** Automatic Git integration
- **HTTPS:** Automatic SSL (Let's Encrypt)
- **CDN:** Vercel's global edge network
- **Features:**
  - Zero-config deployment
  - Automatic HTTPS
  - Native SPA routing
  - Environment variables
  - Deploy previews for PRs

**Mirror Deployment: GitHub Pages**
- **Host:** GitHub Pages
- **URL:** https://karstenwade.github.io/karstenwade.com/
- **Base Path:** `/karstenwade.com/`
- **Deploy Method:** GitHub Actions workflow
- **Branch:** gh-pages (auto-deployed from main)
- **Purpose:** Backup hosting, public visibility

**Deployment Flow:**

*Vercel (Primary):*
1. Push to `main` branch
2. Vercel auto-detects changes
3. Builds with `base: '/'`
4. Deploys to edge network
5. Live at https://karstenwade.com

*GitHub Pages (Mirror):*
1. Push to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions triggered
3. Builds with `base: '/karstenwade.com/'` (env: GITHUB_PAGES=true)
4. Deploys to `gh-pages` branch
5. Live at https://karstenwade.github.io/karstenwade.com/

**Why Both?**
- Vercel: Better performance, zero-config, deploy previews
- GitHub Pages: Public mirror, organization visibility, fallback

## Appendices

### A. Technology Justification

**React + TypeScript:**
- Type safety reduces bugs
- Component reusability
- Large ecosystem
- Excellent tooling

**Vite:**
- Fastest build times
- Modern development experience
- Optimized for static sites
- Better than CRA for this use case

**GitHub Pages:**
- Free hosting with custom domains
- HTTPS included
- Global CDN
- Zero infrastructure management
- Perfect for static sites

### B. Content Strategy

Content is organized by type in data files:
- `src/data/featuredContent.ts` - Home page featured items
- `src/data/papers.ts` - Research papers
- `src/data/poetry.ts` - Poetry collection
- `src/data/fiction.ts` - Fiction stories
- `src/data/cv.ts` - Professional CV
- `src/data/theories.ts` - Frameworks and theories

This approach:
- Separates content from presentation
- Enables easy content updates
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Version controlled

### C. Deployment Strategy

**Single Deployment Target:** GitHub Pages only

**Deployment Flow:**
1. Developer pushes to main
2. GitHub Actions triggered
3. npm run build executed
4. Static files to gh-pages branch
5. GitHub Pages serves content
6. CDN distributes globally

**Rollback Strategy:**
- Revert commit on main branch
- GitHub Actions auto-deploys previous version
- Or manually deploy specific gh-pages commit

---

**Document Version History:**
- v1.0 (2025-11-02): Initial PRD with DreamHost
- v2.0 (2025-11-07): Removed DreamHost, added Epic 8 for custom domain
