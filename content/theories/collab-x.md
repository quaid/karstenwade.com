# CollabX: The Collaborative Experience Framework

CollabX focuses on the **human, cultural aspects** of collaboration—sense of belonging, communication quality, and fairness in interactions.

## Key Concepts

- **Sense of belonging**: How welcome do contributors feel?
- **Communication quality**: Are conversations respectful and productive?
- **Fairness and equity**: Are opportunities and recognition distributed justly?
- **Cultural dynamics**: What norms and values shape the community?

## Applications

CollabX can be used to:
- Diagnose sources of community friction
- Improve team dynamics and psychological safety
- Build more inclusive and welcoming communities
- Measure the "feel" of collaborative environments

## Related Frameworks

CollabX is orthogonal to [ContribX](/theories/contrib-x), which focuses on the technical and process aspects of contribution.
